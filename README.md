## Features

1. Scenario Mode: Adds a new option to the Randomizers dialog at the start of the game, called Scenario Mode. It includes different ways of starting a new game, focused on role-playing. As of now there are four options.
   
- The party has been made into maids by Yterre (skips the Yterre storyline).
- The party has been made into puppets by Samona (skips the Samona fight).
- The party is in debt and has to pay it off at Rokkas Slut Bar (this one is a bit more elaborate).
- The party has been made into cattle by Annie (skips the Gunslinger fight).

2. Bad Dreams Mode: Adds a new option to the Randomizers dialog at the start of the game, called Bad Dreams Mode. It makes it so losing in battle and getting a Bad End might have consequences for your party members. They have vague memories of what could have been, which usually results in an affliction.

3. Real Curses Mode: Adds a new option to the Randomizers dialog at the start of the game, called Real Curses Mode. It makes curses inflicted by enemy attacks, or other means, have long-lasting consequences on their targets. Some of these curses have levels. The higher the level, the more powerful and damaging the curse. These semi-permanent passive skills can be removed using Holy Water, as is usual with curses.

4. Random Maps Mode: Adds a new option to the Randomizers dialog at the start of the game, called Random Maps Mode. It adds some randomness to a few maps, so that you can't just avoid all dangers.

- The traps in the Forsaken Tower are somewhat randomized. There's a pattern, but I won't tell.
- The traps in Alisha's House are completely randomized. Not all of them are dangerous... but most are.

5. Enemy Takeover Mode: Adds a new option to the Randomizers dialog at the start of the game, called Enemy Takeover Mode. It gives some enemies the ability to take over your party. You have to struggle to regain control.

6. Cursed Equipment Mode: Adds a new option to the Randomizers dialog at the start of the game, called Cursed Equipment Mode. It makes some pieces of equipment have a chance to be cursed. You won't be able to tell if they are until you equip them. Once you do, they'll reveal their effects.

7. Toggle options: Adds a new option to the Randomizers dialog at the start of the game, with configurable changes. These will generally make the game more difficult.
 
- Limit fast travel to only work between places with Fast Travel Points.
- Make items that cure status effects hard to come by, and disable spells that cure them. There's a safety measure of sorts, in the form of a creepy clown that resides in one corner of the throne room in Gianna Castle.
- Make most items take up a turn to use in combat, or make them be used instantly.
- Increase the difficulty of ambushes by not being able to escape.
- Increase all enemy stats by 50% (might change in the future).
- Grant access to the Easy Mode cheat room.
- Make chests have a chance to be cursed.

8. Party takeover: Some party members are now able to wrestle control of the party from Lilina. The one in control decides if and when to surrender, and sets where the party will end up after a Bad End, among other things.

9. New rarities: Items have been added to the Rarities Shop in Gianna Castle.
 
- Draining Seashell: An accessory that makes it so no experience is gained from combat.
- Dwarven Alcohol: A consumable that lowers a level when used. Costs the same as an Elixir.

10. New puppet core: The Service Core, which grants access to Maid skills.

11. Skill adjustments: Allow for interesting combinations, such as a succubus Yterre that can still manage her maids.

12. More max level skills: Some of the classes that come from being afflicted with a state now have a skill unlocked when they reach their maximum level. This is meant to encourage the player to not always cure any and all status effects straight away, and give them something more to work towards.

13. Derived skills: Learning a particular set of skills will result in learning a new one. It might be an affliction though...

14. Dronification: Drones in the player's party have an ability that can turn enemies into Drones, making them allies.
