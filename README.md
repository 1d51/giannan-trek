# Giannan Trek

This mod is based on hard mode, and will only work (as is) when selecting that option in the launcher. 
It might work in other modes (with some hiccups) if you modify the contents of the www folder.

## Install Instructions

1. Drag and drop the www folder into the Game folder.
2. Merge and replace everything when asked.

## Features

1. Tougher enemies: All enemy stats have been increased by 50%. This is a work in progress, and might change in the future for better balance. For now, I believe it makes for a much more challenging gameplay, while not being downright impossible.

2. Scenario Mode: Adds a new option to the Randomizers dialog at the start of the game, called Scenario Mode. It includes different ways of starting a new game, focused on role-playing. As of now there are three options.
   
- The party has been made into maids by Yterre (skips the Yterre storyline).
- The party has been made into puppets by Samona (skips the Samona fight).
- The party is in debt and has to pay it off at Rokkas slut bar (this one is a bit more elaborate).
 
3. Party takeover: Some party members are now able to wrestle control of the party from Lilina. The party member in control decides if and when to surrender, and determines where the party will end up after a Bad End.

4. Toggle options: Adds a new option to the Randomizers dialog at the start of the game, with configurable changes. These will generally make the game more difficult.
 
- Limit fast travel to only work between places with Fast Travel Points.
- Make items that cure status effects hard to come by. Disables spells that cure them.
 
5. New rarities: Items have been added to the Rarities Shop in Gianna Castle.
 
- Draining Seashell: An accessory that makes it so no experience is gained from combat.
- Dwarven Alcohol: A consumable that lowers a level when used. Costs the same as an Elixir.

6. New puppet core: The Service Core, which grants access to Maid skills.

7. Randomized maps: Some randomness has been added to a few maps, so that you can't just avoid all dangers.

- The traps in the Forsaken Tower are now somewhat randomized. There's a pattern, but I won't tell.
