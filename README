This mod is based on hard mode, and will only work (as is) when selecting that option in the launcher. 
It might work in other modes (with some hiccups) if you modify the contents of the www folder.

Install Instructions

1. Drag and drop the www folder into the Game folder (the folder is called like that, and should be located within your game's folder, where the launcher is).
2. Merge and replace everything when asked.

Features

1. Scenario Mode: Adds a new option to the Randomizers dialog at the start of the game, called Scenario Mode. It includes different ways of starting a new game, focused on role-playing. As of now there are three options.
   
- The party has been made into maids by Yterre (skips the Yterre storyline).
- The party has been made into puppets by Samona (skips the Samona fight)
- The party is in debt and has to pay it off at Rokkas slut bar (this one is a bit more elaborate).

2. Bad Dreams mode: Adds a new option to the Randomizers dialog at the start of the game, called Bad Dreams Mode. Going through some bad ends might have long lasting consequences. As of now there are three bad dreams.

- Lost Wizard bad end, Sable now gets HUGE(LY) empowered when targeted by the Empower spell.
- The Masters bad end, Lilina can't stand wearing a denial belt, and will try to remove it ASAP.
- Bandits bad end, Lilina, Sinian and Sable might get aroused when fighting bandits.
- Gazers bad end, Lilina has become obsesed with cock. She worships it.
- Alisha's House bad end, Nuan now gets horny from hearing the word "cute".
- Alisha's House bad end, Samona's tits grow heavy with milk, and milking them is only a temporary relief.
- Alisha's House bad end, Yterre can't stand wearing a denial belt, and will try to remove it ASAP.
 
3. Toggle options: Adds a new option to the Randomizers dialog at the start of the game, with configurable changes.
 
- Limit fast travel to only work between places with Fast Travel Points.
- Make items that cure status effects hard to come by. Disables spells that cure them.
 
4. New Rarities: Items have been added to the Rarities Shop in Gianna Castle.
 
- Draining Seashell: An accessory that makes it so no experience is gained from combat. For when you want someone to remain weak.
- Dwarven Alcohol: A consumable that lowers a level when used. Costs the same as an Elixir, so there's no way/reason to exploit it.
